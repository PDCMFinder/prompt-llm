Now I will print out the sentence for 5 times, each time with only one entity marked, the rest of the sentence will be exactly the same as the original sentence.\n\n(1) Overall, our study supports the pursuit of <biomarker>CDK4</biomarker> and CDK6 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for a substantial proportion of HNSCC patients and demonstrates the potential of using PDX models to identify targeted therapies that will benefit patients who have the poorest outcomes.\n\n(2) Overall, our study supports the pursuit of CDK4 and <biomarker>CDK6</biomarker> inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for a substantial proportion of HNSCC patients and demonstrates the potential of using PDX models to identify targeted therapies that will benefit patients who have the poorest outcomes.\n\n(3) Overall, our study supports the pursuit of CDK4 and CDK6 <treatment>inhibitors</treatment> as a therapeutic strategy for a substantial proportion of HNSCC patients and demonstrates the potential of using PDX models to identify targeted therapies that will benefit patients who have the poorest outcomes.\n\n(4) Overall, our study supports the pursuit of CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for a substantial proportion of HNSCC patients and demonstrates the potential of using PDX models to identify <treatment>targeted therapies</treatment> that will benefit patients who have the poorest outcomes.\n\n(5) Overall, our study supports the pursuit of CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for a substantial proportion of <diagnosis>HNSCC</diagnosis> patients and demonstrates the potential of using PDX models to identify targeted therapies that will benefit patients who have the poorest outcomes.\n\n(6) Overall, our study supports the pursuit of CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitors as a therapeutic strategy for a substantial proportion of HNSCC patients and demonstrates the potential of using <model_type>PDX</model_type> models to identify targeted therapies that will benefit patients who have the poorest outcomes."]}
